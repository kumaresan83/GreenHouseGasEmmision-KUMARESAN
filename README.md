# GreenHouseGasEmmision-KUMARESAN
üåç Understanding Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Their Impact on Climate we can Predict 
Description:

This project explores the causes, sources, and effects of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions on global climate patterns. It highlights the major contributors to emissions‚Äîincluding electricity production, transport, agriculture, and industry‚Äîand explains how they lead to global warming. Special focus is given to India‚Äôs growing emissions, their impact, and the measures being taken to reduce them. The project also outlines global efforts such as the Paris Agreement and the importance of sustainable development, renewable energy, and afforestation.

The aim is to raise awareness about the urgency of reducing emissions and to suggest practical steps individuals and governments can take to build a low-carbon future.

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting the long-term impacts of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions on the environment, climate, and socio-economic systems. By leveraging historical emission data and current trends, the model aims to forecast future emission levels and their potential consequences‚Äîsuch as global temperature rise, sea-level changes, extreme weather events, and ecological disruption.

Using statistical analysis, data visualization, and predictive modeling techniques (e.g., linear regression, time series forecasting, or machine learning), the project evaluates the relationship between emission sources (e.g., industry, agriculture, energy) and key climate indicators. The ultimate goal is to provide actionable insights that can inform policy decisions, help mitigate environmental risks, and support sustainable development strategies.


üìä Key Objectives:
Analyze historical GHG emission data by region and sector.

Predict future emission levels under various scenarios (e.g., business-as-usual vs. green policy).

Assess the environmental and climate impact of those emissions.

Visualize trends using graphs, dashboards, or maps.

Recommend mitigation strategies based on model outputs.

üîß Tools & Technologies (optional section):
Python / R for data processing and modeling

Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn

Climate datasets (e.g., IPCC, NASA, EDGAR)
